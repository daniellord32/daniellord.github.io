## Welcome

Welcome to my github page, 

I have been developing professionally for three years, the majority of the work I have done before I went to university was small websites that looked awful but performed well. (You gotta start somewhere you know).

I started in the wonderful world of Java during my studies for my foundation degree and taught myself C/C++ which was the start of my Shorts 360 project. I continue to contribute to that project when time allows.

I am now a php developer working on some pretty exciting projects.

You can get a description of all my projects that I am working on below. Feel free to contribute or improve my code.

## Projects

### Beaver Scouts Registration

This project started it's life as a Foundation degree final year project. The system allows a signed in admin user to do the following:
- add a new user to the system
- track donations made to the organisation
- track attendance of beavers week on week

### Shorts 360 for Flight simulator

This project was created as my final year project at university. The project is a 3d model created in blender that represents the real aircraft (as best as my modelling capabilities would allow) this included animations.

Along with this is source files of the aircrafts gauges that would take data from the simulator and display to the user. The level of detail that could be obtained includes replicating conditions such as oil leaks, or engine fires. All the gauges are written in C/C++ and was compiled using Visual studio 2015.
