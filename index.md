## Projects

### Shorts 360 for Flight simulator

This project was created as my final year project at univercity. The project is a 3d model created in blender that represents the real aircraft (as best as my modelling capabilities would allow) this included animations.

Along with this is source files of the aircrafts guages that would take data from the simulator and display to the user. The level of detail that could be obtained is replicating conditions such as oil leaks, or engine fires. All the gauges are written in C/C++ and was compiled using Visual studio 2015.
