## Welcome

Welcome to my github page, 

I have been developing professionally for three years, the majority of the work I have done before I went to university was small websites that looked awful but performed well. (You gotta start somewhere you know).

I started in the wonderful world of Java during my studies for my foundation degree and taught myself C/C++ which was the start of my Shorts 360 project. I continue to contribute to that project when time allows.

I am now a php developer working on some pretty exciting projects.

You can get a description of all my projects that I am working on below. Feel free to contribute or improve my code.

## Projects

### react-data-table-component

recenetly for a work project I am starting to move the back end away from laravel blade and more to react. Instead of rebuilding the entire backend ui from scratch I am doing bits and bobs here and there as most people are aware of good ole time constraints. So i built a map component which works really well and is no longer a blade with tons of javascript and jquery. My next task was to decide what I am going ot do with datatables.net. I found a package called react-data-table-componant located [here](https://github.com/jbetancur/react-data-table-component) that ticks all the requirements that we need. so I set out work to include this into our project. Now I am not the best developer out there and my colleagues are miles ahead of me lol, but I learnt some stuff from building this which I thought might be a good first tutorial for me to do. you can access the tutorial by visiting the link below.

### RentalHub

I had an idea, well I visited a website i can not remember the name of it but on it was a pin and this pin had a comment from someone where they would like a centralized location where they can contact their landlord instead of having to go through the rental agency. This got me thinking.... 

propertypal (I live in the UK) you have to find your property then get your mobile talk to a rental agency about this property your interested in to then wait and see if when you can view the property. Sounds pretty lengthy to me.

What if we had a service where you can login to your own account, search for a property and book a viewing there and then. The landlord who also has an account would have created dates in which he/she (or even an agency) are available to show you around your prospective new home!

Of course there is more to think about, legality malarky etc but sounds pretty solid. Keep an eye out here as this is my new shiny project that I am working on.

### Beaver Scouts Registration

This project started it's life as a Foundation degree final year project. The system allows a signed in admin user to do the following:
- add a new user to the system
- track donations made to the organisation
- track attendance of beavers week on week

### Shorts 360 for Flight simulator

This project was created as my final year project at university. The project is a 3d model created in blender that represents the real aircraft (as best as my modelling capabilities would allow) this included animations.

Along with this is source files of the aircrafts gauges that would take data from the simulator and display to the user. The level of detail that could be obtained includes replicating conditions such as oil leaks, or engine fires. All the gauges are written in C/C++ and was compiled using Visual studio 2015.
